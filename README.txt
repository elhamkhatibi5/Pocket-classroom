Pocket Classroom - Fixed build
-----------------------------

Files:
- index.html
- css/style.css
- js/*.js
- sample-capsule.json

How to run:
1) For best results run a local static server, e.g. in the folder run:
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

2) Alternatively open index.html directly in your browser (some browsers restrict module imports when opened via file://).

3) To test quickly: open the Library view -> Import -> choose sample-capsule.json -> then use Learn/Author buttons.

If you want me to seed a capsule into your browser storage automatically, I cannot modify your browser's LocalStorage from here.
